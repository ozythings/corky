# OBS Automation with Puppeteer

This project automates login and navigation for [Amasya University OBS](https://obs.amasya.edu.tr/oibs/std/login.aspx) using Puppeteer.

## üöÄ Features
- Opens the OBS login page.
- Captures the CAPTCHA image.
- Solves the CAPTCHA using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) with `chrome-lens-ocr`.
- Logs in with credentials from `.env`.
- Navigates to the "Ders Kayƒ±t" section.
- (WIP) Handles interaction with iframes.
- Allows browser session to remain open with a timeout function.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then, run:

```sh
npm install
```

### 2. Create a `.env` File
Add your credentials to a `.env` file:

```
usrname=your_username
password=your_password
```

### 3. Run the Script
Execute the script with:

```sh
node index.js
```

This will start the automation process, opening the browser and logging you into the OBS system. It will also attempt to solve the CAPTCHA and navigate to the "Ders Kayƒ±t" section.

### 4. Stop the Browser from Closing
By default, the browser will close after a timeout (roughly 30 seconds, 30*0.8). To stop this from happening, enter `0` in the terminal.
